# Requirements for Atomic Convolutions Protein-Ligand Interaction Analysis
# Generated from Jupyter notebook conversion
# 
# IMPORTANT: This requires Python 3.9-3.12 (NOT Python 3.13+)
# TensorFlow and DeepChem do not yet support Python 3.13
# 
# NOTE: Use --only-binary=all to avoid compilation issues on Windows
# pip install --only-binary=all -r requirements_acnn.txt

# Core scientific computing (using pre-compiled wheels)
numpy>=1.21.0
matplotlib>=3.5.0,<4.0.0
scipy>=1.7.0,<2.0.0

# Machine Learning (version constraints for Python 3.9-3.12 compatibility)
tensorflow>=2.8.0
scikit-learn>=1.0.0,<2.0.0

# Chemistry and Molecular Modeling (prefer conda-forge for these)
# Install these with: conda install -c conda-forge rdkit deepchem
# Or try: pip install --only-binary=all rdkit deepchem
rdkit>=2022.3.0
deepchem>=2.6.0

# Additional dependencies that may be needed by DeepChem
# These often require compilation - use conda if pip fails
mdtraj>=1.9.0
pdbfixer>=1.8.0
openmm>=7.7.0

# Optional: Quantum Machine Learning (for quantum neural network extensions)
# Uncomment the following lines if you want to use quantum features
qiskit>=0.39.0,<1.0.0
qiskit-machine-learning>=0.5.0,<1.0.0

# For Jupyter notebook compatibility (if you want to run the original notebook)
# jupyter>=1.0.0
# ipython>=7.0.0
