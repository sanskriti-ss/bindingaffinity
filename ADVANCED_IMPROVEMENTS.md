cnn_params: lr × 0.5      # Conservative for CNN backbone
transformer_params: lr × 1.5  # Aggressive for attention
classifier_params: lr × 1.0   # Standard for final layers

# AdamW optimizer with better regularization
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(
    param_groups,
    weight_decay=1e-4,  # Stronger regularization
    betas=(0.9, 0.999),
    eps=1e-8
)
```

#### B. Learning Rate Scheduling
- **Warmup phase**: 10 epochs gradual increase
- **Cosine annealing with warm restarts**: T_0=15, T_mult=2
- **Dynamic learning rates**: Different rates for different components

#### C. Advanced Loss Functions
```python
# Combined Loss (default)
loss = MSE_loss + 0.5×MAE_loss + 0.3×Huber_loss

# Focal Loss (alternative)
focal_loss = α × (1-pt)^γ × MSE_loss
```

### 3. Architectural Innovations

#### A. 3D Positional Encoding
```python
# Sinusoidal encoding for 3D spatial coordinates
pe[d, h, w, :] = sin/cos encoding based on (d, h, w) position
```

#### B. Multi-scale Feature Extraction
```python
# Parallel convolution paths
feat1 = conv1x1(x)        # Point-wise features
feat2 = conv3x3(x)        # Local features  
feat3 = conv5x5(x)        # Regional features
feat4 = conv_dilated(x)   # Long-range features
combined = cat([feat1, feat2, feat3, feat4])
```

#### C. Enhanced Attention Mechanisms
- **Channel attention**: Focus on important feature channels
- **Spatial attention**: Focus on important spatial regions
- **Self-attention**: Capture long-range dependencies
- **Cross-attention**: Inter-component relationships

### 4. Training Configuration Improvements

```python
config = {
    'batch_size': 8,           # Larger for stable gradients
    'num_epochs': 100,         # More training time
    'learning_rate': 2e-4,     # Higher base learning rate
    'weight_decay': 1e-4,      # Stronger regularization
    'warmup_epochs': 10,       # Longer warmup

    'loss_type': 'combined',   # Multi-component loss
    'gradient_clip': 1.0       # Gradient clipping
}
```
