# Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction

A comprehensive quantum computational chemistry project for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity using 3D spatial representations and deep learning techniques. This project replicates and extends hybrid methodologies from a recent a research paper [binding affinity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-45269-y) in molecular modeling and drug discovery.

## ðŸ§¬ Project Overview

This project implements a complete pipeline for:

- Processing protein and ligand structures from PDB files
- Converting molecular data to MOL2 format with charges and hydrogens
- Creating 3D voxel representations of protein-ligand binding sites
- Building spatial feature tensors for machine learning models
